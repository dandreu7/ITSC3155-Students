    Variables are referred to “envelop” or “buckets” where information can be maintained and referenced. 
    Variables can be declared by any name or even alphabets like a, aa, abc, etc.
    Variables can be re-declared even after you have declared them for once
    To delete a variable, it uses keyword “del”.
